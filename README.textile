h1. Campfire Bot

This is a multi-purpose and extensible Campfire bot.  I've forked it to get it running for myself along with some misc clean up.  

New commands added are:

* @image me@ to get a random google image result ala Zach Holman's awesome "automating inefficiencies video":http://zachholman.com/2011/01/automating-inefficiencies/
* @beiber me@ to get a random justin beiber image


Internally changes include:

* Added support for multi-word commands
* Added bundler for dependencies management

If you have suggestions for useful or fun plugins, let me know; I'm always looking for new plugins to add on!

h2. CONTRIBUTING

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
